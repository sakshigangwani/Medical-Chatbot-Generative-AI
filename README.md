# 🩺 FlowSync AI Health Assistant

### Multi-Agent AI Health Assistant for Women's Health Support using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

FlowSync AI Health Assistant is a **multi-agent conversational AI system** designed to provide guidance on women's health topics such as hormonal health, symptoms, wellness, and general medical knowledge.

The assistant combines **specialized AI agents** with **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide grounded, contextual responses using medical knowledge sources.

The system integrates:

- OpenAI LLM responses
- Pinecone vector database
- HuggingFace embeddings
- Flask backend
- Chat-based web interface

---

# 📌 Overview

The system intelligently routes each user query to the most suitable **specialist AI agent**.

### Agents

| Agent | Responsibility |
|------|------|
| **MedicalAgent** | Explains medical conditions, concepts, and treatments |
| **SymptomAgent** | Interprets symptoms and suggests possible next steps |
| **LifestyleAgent** | Provides guidance on wellness, nutrition, sleep, stress, and habits |

Each agent can retrieve contextual information from the **vector database** to generate accurate responses.

# ⚙️ Setup

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sakshigangwani/flowsync-ai-health-assistant.git
cd flowsync-ai-health-assistant
```

---

## 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root.

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
```

---

## 5. Verify Setup

```bash
python check_setup.py
```

---

# ▶️ Running the Project

## Step 1 — Build Vector Index

Convert documents into embeddings and store them in Pinecone.

```bash
python store_index.py
```

This step:

- Loads medical documents
- Splits text into chunks
- Generates embeddings
- Stores vectors in Pinecone

---

## Step 2 — Start the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

The web interface includes:

- FlowSync AI health assistant chat
- Typing animation for responses
- Thinking animation while retrieving knowledge
- Clean responsive UI

Example questions:

- What is PCOS?
- Why are my periods irregular?
- What causes hormonal acne?
- What diet helps balance hormones?
